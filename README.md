Simulate impact of gravity on celestial bodies.

This is programmed as a numerical solution to the multi-body problem:
Rather than programming the orbits, I programmed the differential equations.
Starting point is Newton's formula:
\[ F = G * m_1 * m_2 / r^2 \]

There was a little wrestle before I realized what the numerical integration needed.

For now I only added the Sun and the inner 4 planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth., Mars)
